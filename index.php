        <h3 ><P style=" color:navy;">Going on vacation, a business trip or working long hours and cant get home to take care of your pets?  We provide in-home pet care.  We come into your home so you are able to leave your pet in familiar surroundings.  We follow your pet care routine as closely as possible.  This would include feeding, watering, letting outside and exercising.  We can give any medication your pet may require.  We spend quality time with your pet... playing, petting and loving so your pet receives personal attention while you are away.  In addition to caring for your pet, we offer other services such as bringing in your mail and newspaper, alternating lights, opening and closing drapes/blinds and watering plants...  activities that give your home a lived-in look.  Our Pet Care Specialists are bonded and insured.  Our charges are based upon the type and number of pets and the length and frequency of visits made.  We require four days notice so that we have time to set up an in-home consultation with you and your pet(s).  This initial meeting is required before reservations can be confirmed.   In addition to pet sitting, we offer dog walking services, pet taxi, overnight pet sitting, poop patrol, errand service and house sitting.  Write or call us for more details.
